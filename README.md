# Message a Loved One

Do you have unfinished business with a loved one who has passed? Write them a letter in the form below.

## Desired Functionalities

I was considering adding a functionality where you could email yourself a copy of the form you submit and also build out other portions of the navbar. 

## About Form Submit

~~Form submission uses the SmtpJS Server and also elastic mail to email form submissions. Special thanks to [AshisCoding](https://www.youtube.com/@ashiscoding) for helping me set up the SmtJS server in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV-Aqkjju64&t=609).~~

Currently, this is not a feature, and this is currently being looked at.
